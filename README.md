Instructions

Getting Started with Next.js:
Initialize a new Next.js project using create-next-app or by setting up Next.js manually.
Ensure that the project structure is set up correctly, including pages, components, and styles folders.
Styling Components and Displaying Images with Next.js:
Style your components using CSS modules, styled-components, or any other preferred styling method.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
